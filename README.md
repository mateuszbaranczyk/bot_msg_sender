## About The Project

As a simple home project, I created that application with scrap page 19115.pl with trash collection schedule on my home address. The app can send an email with a schedule or provide this information on demand as Telegram Bot. Scripts are running on AWS.

I will appreciate any feedback regarding my code. 

### Installation and usage

Emails are scheduled for frequently sending by [Cron](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto) on my AWS instance.
